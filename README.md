# New WB

Installer script for [WB Starter](https://github.com/wbrowar/WB-Starter)

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (requires v10+)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

## Installation
**New WB** is a Node module that should be installed globally and it downloads the rest of its dependencies via `npm` and `composer`.

To set up **New WB**, run `npm install -g new-wb` to install it to your global NPM modules folder.

## Usage
Follow these steps to generate a new Craft 3 website:

1. `cd` into your parked Valet directory (or wherever you host local web projects)
2. Run `new-wb`
3. Enter in the required information requested by various sets of prompts. Questions are asked by different installation toolsâ€”and may change over time.
    
By default and when possible, command line output is suppressed, however, you can see all command output and confirmation logs by adding the `--verbose` option. This could be useful for debugging.

## Options
Arguments that are available when running `new-wb`:

| Argument | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--dev` | *false* | Use the `dev` branch of WB Starter for installation. |
| `--verbose` | *false* | Displays command confirmations and extra command line output. |

## Contributing
To test locally, remove any existing versions of `new-wb`, clone this repo, and run this command:

```
npm uninstall -g new-wb && npm install -g PATH_TO_LOCAL
```
